# OttawaNextBus

OttawaNextBus is an original Python project that I have created to demonstrate the object-oriented programming concepts I have learned at Algonquin College and through self-study. This application retrieves real-time information from OC Transpo and presents it in an organized and user-friendly manner. Users can effortlessly search for stops using keywords, store and retrieve preferred routes, and visualize bus locations in real-time on an interactive map.

The project showcases my understanding of various object-oriented programming concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, exception handling, collections, API integration, JSON parsing, and more. It serves as evidence of my proficiency in these areas and demonstrates my ability to apply my knowledge to create practical and useful applications.

To run this application, you can download and extract the compiled .zip file from https://github.com/Kian-Choi/OttawaNextBus/blob/master/output/OttawaNextBus.zip and execute OttawaNextBus.exe.
